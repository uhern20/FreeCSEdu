/*
LOOPS PRACTICE (for, while, do-while)

Instructions:

PART 1: FOR LOOP
- Ask the user for a positive integer n
- Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to n

PART 2: WHILE LOOP
- Ask the user for another positive integer m
- Use a while loop to print numbers from m down to 1

PART 3: DO-WHILE LOOP
- Ask the user for a number
- Use a do-while loop to print the number at least once
- Keep asking until the user enters 0

Example Output:
Enter n: 5
1 2 3 4 5

Enter m: 3
3 2 1

Enter a number (0 to stop): 7
You entered: 7
Enter a number (0 to stop): 0
