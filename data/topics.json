    "details": "C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming language designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985. Developed as an extension of another programming language C, hence why the '++' was added into the name of the language. C++ in the modern world is used in various fields of technology which includes things such as: game development, database systems, game graphics, and many more. Here I will provide you various resources of my own such as some minor projects to work on yourself and other external resources that are extremely valuable to you learning this language.",
