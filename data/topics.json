    "details": "This section introduces you to the essential components of C++ programming. You'll learn about basic data types like int, float, double, char, and bool that store different kinds of information. We'll cover how to use cin to get user input and cout to display output. You'll also learn the basic structure of functions - how to write them, what they look like, and why they're useful. These are the building blocks you need to start writing C++ programs.",

Developed as an extension of another programming language C, hence why the '++' was added into the name of the language. C++ in the modern world is used in various fields of technology which includes things such as: game development, database systems, game graphics, and many more. Here I will provide you various resources of my own such as some minor projects to work on yourself and other external resources that are extremely valuable to you learning this language.",
